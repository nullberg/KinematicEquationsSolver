# Kinematic Equations Solver (KES)

This project concerns a Java GUI for solving kinematics problems. To run the app, download KES.jar in the dist folder and open it. The documentation PDF file is also in this folder. The NetBeans folder contains a ZIP file which can be imported with the NetBeans IDE to further work on the project. Finally src contains the *java files, however the best way to build on the project is through the ZIP file.

## Sample usage

Below is an image of the app.
