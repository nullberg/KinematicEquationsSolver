# Kinematic Equations Solver (KES)

Any beginner's course in physics will involve solving of the kinematic equations as derived from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics">classical mechanics</a>. Basically these equations can be used to figure out quantities like distance traveled or final velocity, based on other initial parameters, and assuming constant acceleration. Such quantities, under such conditions, are useful not only to a beginner but also to almost anyone. So instead of redoing the algebra over and over again every time you have a system you need to solve, this app allows you to just input the parameters and get the output. I used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetBeans">NetBeans IDE</a> with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface_builder">UI builder</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java">Java</a> programming language.

Below I show an image with an example of using the app:

One exquisite feature of the app is that it dynamically monitors the inputs in the "Given" section so that not more than a maximum of three input values are allowed. This prevents a contradiction from occuring.

<!--
This project concerns a Java GUI for solving kinematics problems. To run the app, download KES.jar in the dist folder and open it. The documentation PDF file is also in this folder. The NetBeans folder contains a ZIP file which can be imported with the NetBeans IDE to further work on the project. Finally src contains the *java files, however the best way to build on the project is through the ZIP file.

## Example usage

Below is an image of the app, with some example inputs and output. Note that in the "Given" section, 2 textfields are disabled. The first is of course the parameter which was selected for "Find", which is Displacement. The other textfield was disabled as soon as 3 values for parameters had been specified. It is a contradiction to have more than 3 "Given" values.
